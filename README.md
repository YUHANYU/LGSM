This is the code of LSGM.
The default multi-label learning dataset is Yeast. 
If you want to run this program, please use the command "python main.py".  
Please note that if you use other data sets, you may need to modify the learning rate to get good results.

# Note
The code is not highly optimized, so the runtime will be very long. It takes about 6 hours to get the final result.
Please wait patiently.

# How to use
Excute the command: python main.py
If you want to modify the mll dataset or other parameters, please modify the main.py or parameters.py
